# Blink
Blink is a a device that helps blind people in navigation by using a object detection system with a tracking based algorithm, a openai api based generative ai, and a voice recognition that allows the user to seamlessly understand and navigate their surroundings and a gps system with directions using googles directions and geolocation api.

#How to run and test the programs:
## Step1: 
Create a `virtual enviornment` to install all the required libraries. These libraries will be required to run the programs. I would recommend using an IDE such as Pycharm as they have direct ways to create a new virtual enviornment when creating a new project or when creating a new interpreter.

## Step2:
Install all libraries in the `requirements.txt` file either by duplicating it and opening it in a IDE like Pycharm or by manually downloading them through pip.

## Step3:
Duplicate the rest of the files into the virtual enviornment and run and test the various programs.
